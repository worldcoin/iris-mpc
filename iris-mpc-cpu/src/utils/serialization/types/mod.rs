//! This module implements stable types to represent serialization formats which
//! will can be stably referenced while the codebase is changing.  In general
//! this module aims to have one submodule for each "file format" which is
//! produced or consumed by the codebase at some stage of development, with
//! possible exceptions for lower-level data types related to serialization
//! formats of external libraries.
