# For secret sharing, one should be able to convert the ring elements to the

# shares are converted to basis B.  Then the dot product of query and
# database shares gives the analog of the "constant coefficient in the
# monomial basis" used in the original protocol, but here the MPC parties are
# able to produce the database shares themselves since it is accomplished by
# just a change of basis from the query shares.
